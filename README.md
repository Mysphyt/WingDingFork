# WingDingFork
A [BrainFuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter, but it's [WingDings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingdings)

### Running:
```
.\app\dingfork.exe
```
### Configuration:
* [config](./dingfork/data/config.yml): configuration setttings
```
  dataConfigName : name of the keymap and subroutine directory in data
```
* `Subroutines` are lists of instructions saved in the configured data folder (ie [default/subroutines/](./dingfork/data/default/subroutines/) )
  * The name of each subroutine file corresponds with the instruction name in [keymap](./dingfork/data/default/keymap)
    * The line `🐻|b^buffalo_bill` maps the key wingding `🐻` to the keyboard shortbut `b` and the subroutine instruction `buffalo_bill`
* [keymap](./dingfork/data/default/keymap): maps keyboard keys to WingDing symbols and instructions.
   * Includes `subroutine` key mappings as [wingding|key^subroutine_name] 
   * Additional instruction for resetting memory [`cls_tape`]
```
INSTRUCTIONS:
   
   inc_data : Increment the data pointer by one (to point to the next cell to the right).
   dec_data : Decrement the data pointer by one (to point to the next cell to the left).
   inc_byte : Increment the byte at the data pointer by one.
   dec_byte : Decrement the byte at the data pointer by one.
   out_byte : Output the byte at the data pointer.
   inp_byte : Accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.
   loop_bgn : If the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command.
   loop_end : If the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching [ command.[a]
   cls_tape : Resets memory (tape) to zeroed state.

### TODO
#### Features
- [ ] Convert text to WingDings, including subroutines
  - Text(file) -> BrainFuck -> WingDings -> SubWingDings
- [ ] Dynamic menus
- [ ] Dynamic unit tests
- [ ] Global Unicode and UTF8 modes
- [ ] Load code from an arbitrary text file
#### Bugs
- [x] Fix user entered wingdings not being rendered
 - Saving subroutines, or other user entered WingDings that don't go through the filesystem
 - Reading wingdings from files or hardcoded seems to work
