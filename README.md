### Running:
```
.\app\dingfork.exe
```

### Usage:

#### Enter or paste your [code] from the following (default) instructions, or modify the mapping file with different WingDings.

* [keymap](./dingfork/data/keymap.csv) maps keyboard keys to WingDing instructions.
   * Additional instruction for resetting memory (default üí£ : !)

* [instructionmap](./dingfork/data/instructionmap.csv) maps WingDings to Brainfuck instructions.
```
INSTRUCTIONS:
   
   inc_data : Increment the data pointer by one (to point to the next cell to the right).
   dec_data : Decrement the data pointer by one (to point to the next cell to the left).
   inc_byte : Increment the byte at the data pointer by one.
   dec_byte : Decrement the byte at the data pointer by one.
   out_byte : Output the byte at the data pointer.
   inp_byte : Accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.
   loop_bgn : If the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command.
   loop_end : If the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching [ command.[a]
   cls_tape : Resets memory (tape) to zeroed state.

```

* You may create or save "subroutines", just make sure to add the name of the subroutine (ex: üïø) to keymap.csv`
   - This is currently buggy when combining subroutines
